    <h2>About PorkyTheChop</h2>
   <p>
    Hello there! I see you have stumbled upon my blog &ndash; you obviously didn&apos;t come here on purpose. Anyway, I&apos;m a 15 year old boy in Tennessee. I am knowledgeable about a great deal of topics, so I appologise in advance I ramble on about too many subjects at once.
   </p>
   <p>
    Currently, I am learning to play the ukulele, and I played the french horn for three years in middle school. I enjoy music very much; it is a huge aspect of my life. Some of my favorite genres are french pop and Hawaiian, Israel Kamakawiwo&apos;ole being my favorite Hawaiian singer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another topic that I love is pets! I have two dogs: Rainbow &ndash; a pitbull &ndash;, and Phteven &ndash; a chiweenie. I love them very dearly, and I view them as members of my family. 
   </p>

    My favorite subjects at school are math and French. I have taken French since I was in 7th grade, and now I&apos;m in French IV. Next year I plan on continuing learning French by taking the AP French course. Career-wise, I hope to become a programmer; however I don't know what exactly I want to do yet. I learned HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript in school, and I learned some Swift on my own.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of my favorite games include the Sims 3, Minecraft, the Blockheads, and Stardew Valley. I have been playing the Sims for a while. I have many versions of it, but Sims 3 is my favorite. As for Minecraft, I usually play it with the Thaumcraft 4 mod on minecraft 1.7.10. That&apos;s my favorite way to play. The Blockheads has drawn me in time and time again, since 2013. I began before multiplayer was released, but I have been back to play multiple times. I have several servers, some of which you can find listed on the sidebar. Finally, Stardew Valley is addicting. When I play it, I can&apos;t put it down for days.

     One of my favorite topics to discuss is food, especially coffee. You see, I&apos;m a bit of a coffee fanatic. I prefer it with only milk; I believe that coffee is meant to be bitter, so I rarely add sugar. From time to time I will add some honey to change things up, but I mostly only drink plain coffee with milk. Earl grey is my favorite kind of tea, and I again drink it with no sweetener.
